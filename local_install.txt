1. export ARGOS_INSTALL_PATH=$HOME/your_name if you want to install argos3 into $HOME/your_name/argos3-dist, otherwise choose the location to your liking
2. create the argos3-dist folder in the above location (or whatever you call it)
3. install things, follow the procedure as normal, there is just an additional parameter in the cmake command.
Here is an example with argos3

mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$ARGOS_INSTALL_PATH/argos3-dist -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../src
make -j8
make doc
make install
