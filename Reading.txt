		"Each state is associated with a set of possible actions that can be taken to transition from one state to the other. The target policy may be deterministic—given a state it always executes the same action—or stochastic—the action to be performed is chosen with a certain probability; while the behavior policy must be stochastic (Sutton and Barto, 2018)."
